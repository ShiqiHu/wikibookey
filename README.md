## Description
The project aims to use Wikipedia as the key resource to build books that will focus topics that a reader wants to read, as if the reader were to purchase a complete, coherent book from the bookstore.

In this project, we would like to build an interface that users can interact with the content in Wikipedia. In our project, there would be two main function, automatically producing the book for the users and customizing the book by the users. For automatically producing the book, the user would search the specific topic in our website, and then the website would linked to the relative page of wikipedia. According to the content in Wikibookey, we would category those content by their title into the introduction part, main part and conclusion. In the main part, we would use the wiks APIs to link different part to different chapters. For the customizing part, after linking to Wikipedia, user would click the content they want in Wikipedia and also tag those part with different categories or different chapters. User could also be able to add chapters or specific content to the book, besides, they can also sort the content as they want. After the user has confirm the book, a PDF can be exported and downloaded so that the user can read the book locally. For the whole project, we want to keep the process simple but also try to realize more functions to allow users customize the book.

In order to build the web application, we will use Ruby on Rails. Also, we will do some research to see if there are any API we could use to assist us implementing some functions such as Wikipedia searching function.

Just testing
